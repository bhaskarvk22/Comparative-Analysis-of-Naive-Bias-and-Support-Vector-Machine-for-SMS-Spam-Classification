# Comparative-Analysis-of-Naive-Bias-and-Support-Vector-Machine-for-SMS-Spam-Classification

The number of mobile phone users is growing
steadily each day. Short Message Service (SMS) is a text
messaging application accessible on smartphones and entry-level
mobile devices. Consequently, the usage of SMS has increased
in recent years. Spam messages have increased in tandem with
this trend. Spammers send spam messages to achieve financial
or business advantages, such as promoting market growth,
spreading details of lottery tickets. Thus, spam classification has
gained particular attention in recent times. In the presented work,
Machine Learning (ML) methods viz., Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) are are applied for SMS spam
classification. The comparative study showed that and accuracy
of 94% and 88.8% was achieved for SVM and NB respectively.
The SVM outperformed NB in terms accuracy, precision, recall
and F1 score with values of 0.94, 0.95, 0.93 and 0.94 respectively.
Index Termsâ€”Spam, Ham, Classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB).
